## Installation

### Windows
Download and run the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/avsaase/walksnail-osd-tool/releases/latest).

### MacOS
Download the app bundle for your processor architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/avsaase/walksnail-osd-tool/releases/latest) and drag it to your Applications folder.

<summary>Instructions for running the first time</summary>
    
The MacOS binaries provided by this project are not signed with a "Developer ID Certificate". When you try to run the app for the first time you may get a warning from MacOS that it may be malicious software, the developer cannot be verified, it may be damaged, etc. Close the warning, go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway". This should only be required the first time you open the app.

If you think this is annoying you can donate some money [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/avsaase) so I can pay Apple for a developer account.

### Linux
The project builds on Ubuntu in CI but I haven't tried runnning it myself. I don't know enough about packaging for Linux to make release binaries so for now you need to build from source.

### OSD Font Files
This repo contains some font files from Betaflight, ArduPilot and INAV. These can be found in [resources/osd/](https://github.com/avsaase/walksnail-osd-tool/tree/master/resources/osd).

### Building from source
1. Install the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Run `cargo install --git https://github.com/avsaase/walksnail-osd-tool.git`. The executable will be installed in `$HOME/.cargo/bin/` and added to your path.
3. To run the app you need the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries in your `path` or placed next to the executable you just build.
4. Run the app with `walksnail-osd-tool`.

- [kirek007/ws-osd-py](https://github.com/kirek007/ws-osd-py): Python-based tool with GUI and CLI. No longer maintained in favor of this project but has a few features that this project currently lacks. Depending on your OS it can require some manual setup due to Python dependencies.
- [shellixyz/hd_fpv_video_tool](https://github.com/shellixyz/hd_fpv_video_tool): Rust-based CLI tool with support for with Walksnail and DJI. Mainly targets Linux and can be difficult to build from source on Windows and MacOS. Has some cool features like live playback of the DVR with OSD without rendering.
